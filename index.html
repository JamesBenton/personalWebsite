                <p>This website is for me to test different projects that I am working on. Currently I am working on getting my 3D printer to a completely working state. I have an Anet A8. It is a fantastic printer if you are interested in how things work, as I am. Otherwise, get a different printer.</p>
                <p>In the future, I will practice building an entire website for my personal company, AEBCS, instead of using just a Wordpress blog. For now the company does not make enough money to warrant paying for hosting, but it should be there in a few months.</p>
                <p>Visit the "Projects" page for progress on my homework and project web app.</p>
                <p>Eventually I am going to use git to push updates directly to the website.</p>
