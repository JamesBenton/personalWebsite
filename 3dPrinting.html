                <p>The 3D Printer that I have is the Anet A8. This printer is definitely not for starters and purchasers either need to have experience with mechanics and electronics, or need to be willing to learn. When I bought the printer, it came with a microSD card and a USB microSD card reader. There was nothing in the packaging that said that assembly instructions were on the SD card, so I ended up following some videos I found online of a guy assembling an older version.</p>
                <p>Eventually I completed the build process, but the printer still wasn't working quite right. I ended up taking the extruder apart and removing one of the nuts. Doing this worried me because I didn't think I should've had to remove a part, but the printer has worked correctly (for the most part) since that modification.</p>
